Boa Lab was an architectural studio I co-founded with Oriana Arpino, where we focused on innovation, design, and creativity. My responsibilities included:

- **Design Decision-Making**: Making design decisions on various projects to ensure they met client needs and architectural standards.
- **Technical Documentation**: Preparing detailed technical documentation for projects to facilitate construction and project management.
- **Site Supervision**: Visiting construction sites to supervise the progress of various construction trades and ensure the quality and adherence to project specifications.
- **Client Demos and Presentations**: Conducting demos for clients and delivering commercial presentations to showcase project plans and progress.

At Boa Lab, we specialized in renovation projects, home extensions, and PHs, always striving to push the boundaries of innovation and creativity in our designs.
