At Estudio Darwin, I held the role of an Architect with the following responsibilities:

- **Design Decision-Making**: Making design decisions on various projects to ensure they met client needs and architectural standards.
- **Technical Documentation**: Preparing detailed technical documentation for projects to facilitate construction and project management.
- **Site Supervision**: Visiting construction sites to supervise the progress of various construction trades and ensure the quality and adherence to project specifications.
- **Client Demos and Presentations**: Conducting demos for clients and delivering commercial presentations to showcase project plans and progress.

The projects I worked on were focused on residential homes, commercial spaces, and retail stands. My role involved a blend of creative design, technical precision, and client interaction to deliver successful architectural projects.
