Coderhouse is an institution dedicated to teaching various aspects of development. In my role as a JavaScript Mentor, I was responsible for:

- **Class Assistance**: Providing support during JavaScript classes and courses to ensure a smooth learning experience for students.
- **Student Work Review**: Correcting and providing feedback on students' assignments and projects to help them improve their coding skills.
- **Query Resolution**: Answering students' questions related to the topics covered in class, ensuring they have a clear understanding of the material.
- **After-Class Support**: Conducting additional support sessions, known as after-class, to assist students with any difficulties they encountered during the coursework.

My role involved fostering a collaborative and supportive learning environment, ensuring that each student received the guidance they needed to succeed in their JavaScript learning journey.
